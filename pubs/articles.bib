  abstract = {Mind wandering (MW) is a mental phenomenon humans experience daily. Yet, we lack a complete understanding of the neural basis of this pervasive mental state. Over the past decade there has been an increase in publications using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to modulate the propensity to mind wander, but findings are diverse, and a satisfactory conclusion is missing. Recently, Boayue et al. (2020) reported successful reduction of mind wandering using high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, providing preliminary evidence for the efficacy of HD-tDCS in interfering with mind wandering. The current study is a high-powered, pre-registered direct replication attempt of the effect found by Boayue et al. (2020). In addition, we investigated whether the effects of HD-tDCS on mind wandering would be prolonged and assessed the underlying processes of mind wandering using electroencephalography (EEG) and pupillometry during a finger-tapping random sequence generation task that requires the use of executive resources. We failed to find any evidence of the original effect of reduced MW during and after stimulation. When combining our data with the data from Boayue et al. (2020), the original effect of reduced MW caused by HD-tDCS disappeared. In addition, we observed increased occipital alpha power as task duration increased and increased midfrontal theta power preceding response patterns signaling high executive function use. Finally, tonic and phasic pupil size decreased as task duration increased yet, phasic responses were increased, while tonic responses were reduced preceding reports of MW. Additionally phasic pupil size also showed a tendency to be increased during periods of high executive function use. Importantly, none of the EEG or pupil measures were modulated by HD-tDCS. We conclude that HD-tDCS over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex does not affect MW propensity and its neural signatures. Furthermore, we recommend that previously reported effects of tDCS on mind wandering and other cognitive functions should only be accepted after a successful pre-registered replication.},

Several priming conditions were realized in a mix of control (CO), negative priming (NP), and positive priming (PP) trials. PP and NP effects in reaction times (RTs) were significant. ERP results conceptually replicate earlier findings of left-posterior P300 reduction in PP and NP trials compared to CO. This ERP effect may reflect the detection of prime-probe similarity corresponding to the concept of a retrieval cue. A novel finding concerned amplitude increase of the frontal late positive complex (LPC) in the order NP, CO, and PP. NP therefore seemed to induce brain activity related to cognitive control and/or memory processes, with reduced LPC amplitude indicating effortful processing. Overall, retrieval-based explanations of identity NP are supported.},

  abstract = {Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been proposed to be able to modulate different cognitive functions. However, recent meta-analyses conclude that its efficacy is still in question. Recently, an increase in subjects' propensity to mind-wander has been reported as a consequence of anodal stimulation of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Axelrod et~al., Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 112, 2015). In addition, an independent group found a decrease in mind wandering after cathodal stimulation of the same region. These findings seem to indicate that high-level cognitive processes such as mind wandering can reliably be influenced by non-invasive brain stimulation. However, these previous studies used low sample sizes and are as such subject to concerns regarding the replicability of their findings. In this registered report, we implement a high-powered replication of Axelrod et~al. (2015) finding that mind-wandering propensity can be increased by anodal tDCS. We used Bayesian statistics and a preregistered sequential-sampling design resulting in a total sample size of N~=~192 participants collected across three different laboratories. Our findings show support against a stimulation effect on self-reported mind-wandering scores. The effect was small, in the opposite direction as predicted and not reliably different from zero. Using a Bayes Factor specifically designed to test for replication success, we found strong evidence against a successful replication of the original study. Finally, even when combining data from both the original and replication studies, we could not find evidence for an effect of anodal stimulation. Our results underline the importance of designing studies with sufficient power to detect evidence for or against behavioural effects of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, preferentially using robust Bayesian statistics in preregistered reports.},

  abstract = {While the involvement of executive processes in mind wandering is largely undebated, their exact relationship is subject to an ongoing debate and rarely studied dynamically within-subject. Several brain-stimulation studies using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have attempted to modulate mind-wandering propensity by stimulating the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) which is an important hub in the prefrontal control network. In a series of three studies testing a total of N = 100 participants, we develop a novel task that allows to study the dynamic interplay of mind wandering, behavioural varibility and the flexible recruitment of executive resources as indexed by the randomness (entropy) of movement sequences generated by our participants. We consistently find that behavioural variability is increased and randomness is decreased during periods of mind wandering. Interestingly, we also find that behavioural variability interacts with the entropy-MW effect, opening up the possibility to detect distinct states of off-focus cognition. When applying a high-definition transcranial direct-current stimulation (HD-tDCS) montage to the left DLPFC, we find that propensity to mind wander is reduced relative to a group receiving sham stimulation.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) above the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) has been widely used to improve symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, the effects of different stimulation protocols in the entire frontal lobe have not been investigated in a large sample including patient data. METHODS: We used 38 head models created from structural magnetic resonance imaging data of 19 healthy adults and 19 MDD patients and applied computational modeling to simulate the spatial distribution of tDCS-induced electric fields (EFs) in 20 frontal regions. We evaluated effects of seven bipolar and two multi-electrode 4\,×\,1 tDCS protocols. RESULTS: For bipolar montages, EFs were of comparable strength in the lDLPFC and in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). Depending on stimulation parameters, EF cortical maps varied to a considerable degree, but were found to be similar in controls and patients. 4\,×\,1 montages produced more localized, albeit weaker effects. LIMITATIONS: White matter anisotropy was not modeled. The relationship between EF strength and clinical response to tDCS could not be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to lDLPFC stimulation, excitability changes in the MPFC should also be considered as a potential mechanism underlying clinical efficacy of bipolar montages. MDD-associated anatomical variations are not likely to substantially influence current flow. Individual modeling of tDCS protocols can substantially improve cortical targeting. We make recommendations for future research to explicitly test the contribution of lDLPFC vs. MPFC stimulation to therapeutic outcomes of tDCS in this disorder.},

  abstract = {The ability to control the occurrence of rewarding and punishing events is crucial for our well-being. Two ways to optimize performance are to follow heuristics like Pavlovian biases to approach reward and avoid loss or to rely more on slowly accumulated stimulus–action associations. Although reduced control over outcomes has been linked to suboptimal decision-making in clinical conditions associated with learned helplessness, it is unclear how uncontrollability of the environment is related to the arbitration between different response strategies. This study directly tested whether a behavioral manipulation designed to induce learned helplessness in healthy adults (intermittent loss of control over feedback in a reinforcement learning task; “yoking”) would modulate the magnitude of Pavlovian bias and the neurophysiological signature of cognitive control (frontal midline theta power) in healthy adults. Using statistical analysis and computational modeling of behavioral data and electroencephalographic signals, we found stronger Pavlovian influences and alterations in frontal theta activity in the yoked group. However, these effects were not accompanied by reduced performance in experimental blocks with regained control, indicating that our behavioral manipulation was not potent enough for inducing helplessness and impaired coping ability with task demands. We conclude that the level of contingency between instrumental choices and rewards/punishments modulates Pavlovian bias during value-based decision-making, probably via interfering with the implementation of cognitive control. These findings might have implications for understanding the mechanisms underlying helplessness in various psychiatric conditions.},

  abstract = {Recent studies suggest that choice behavior in reinforcement learning tasks is shaped by the level of outcome controllability. In particular, “Pavlovian bias” (PB) seems to be enhanced under low levels of control, manifesting in approach tendencies towards rewards and response inhibition when facing potential losses. The medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) has been implicated both in evaluating outcome controllability and in the recruitment of cognitive control to suppress maladaptive PB during reinforcement learning. The current study tested if high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) above the mPFC of healthy humans can influence PB, and counteract the previously documented, deleterious behavioral effects of low outcome controllability on decision-making. In a pre-registered, between-group, double-blind study (N = 103 adults, both sexes), we tested the interaction between controllability and HD-tDCS on parameters of choice behavior in a Go/NoGo task. Relative to sham stimulation, HD-tDCS resulted in more robust performance improvement following reduced control, an effect that was more pronounced in appetitive trials. In addition, we found evidence for weaker PB when HD-tDCS was administered during low controllability over outcomes. Computational modeling revealed that parameter estimates of learning rate and choice randomness were modulated by controllability, HD-tDCS and their interaction. Overall, these results highlight the potential of our HD-tDCS protocol for interfering with choice arbitration under low levels of control, resulting in more adaptive behavior. Significance statement Our decisions are shaped by how much control we have over the situation. Under extreme circumstances, low controllability of choice outcomes can lead to learned helplessness (LH) and impaired coping. Since the medial prefrontal cortex was implicated in LH, we tested if high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) of this region counteracts the deleterious effects of low controllability of rewards and losses in healthy humans. We found stronger improvement in response accuracy when low controllability was combined with HD-tDCS. Moreover, several latent parameters of choice behavior were influenced by HD-tDCS and/or controllability. These results highlight the potential of our HD-tDCS protocol for interfering with choice arbitration in environments with reduced controllability, resulting in more adaptive behavior.},

Although the sustained attention to response task is commonly used to examine relationships between mind wandering and executive functions, limited executive resources are required for optimal task performance. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between mind wandering and executive functions more closely by employing a recently developed finger-tapping task to monitor fluctuations in attention and executive control through task performance and periodical experience sampling during concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pupillometry. Our results show that mind wandering was preceded by increases in finger-tapping variability, which was correlated with activity in dorsal and ventral attention networks. The entropy of random finger-tapping sequences was related to activity in frontoparietal regions associated with executive control, demonstrating the suitability of this paradigm for studying executive functioning. The neural correlates of behavioral performance, pupillary dynamics, and self-reported attentional state diverged, thus indicating a dissociation between direct and indirect markers of mind wandering. Together, the investigation of these relationships at both the behavioral and neural level provided novel insights into the identification of underlying mechanisms of mind wandering.},

Although such task-unrelated thoughts (TUTs) are pervasive and detrimental to task performance, their underlying neural mechanisms are only modestly understood. To investigate TUTs with high spatial and temporal precision, we simultaneously measured fMRI, EEG, and pupillometry in healthy adults while they performed a sustained attention task with experience sampling probes. Features of interest were extracted from each modality at the single-trial level and fed to a support vector machine that was trained on the probe responses. Compared to task-focused attention, the neural signature of TUTs was characterized by weaker activity in the default mode network but elevated activity in its anticorrelated network, stronger functional coupling between these networks, widespread increase in alpha, theta, delta, but not beta, frequency power, predominantly reduced amplitudes of late, but not early, event-related potentials, and larger baseline pupil size. Particularly, information contained in dynamic interactions between large-scale cortical networks was predictive of transient changes in attentional focus above other modalities. Together, our results provide insight into the spatiotemporal dynamics of TUTs and the neural markers that may facilitate their detection.},

As cognitive models are developed and extended, they tend to increase in complexity–leading to more precise predictions–which places concomitant demands on the behavioral data used to discriminate between candidate theories. To aid discrimination between cognitive models and, more recently, to constrain parameter estimation, neural data have been used as an adjunct to behavioral data, or as a central stream of information, in the evaluation of cognitive models. Such a model-based neuroscience approach entails many advantages, including precise tests of hypotheses about brain–behavior relationships. There have, however, been few systematic investigations of the capacity for neural data to constrain the recovery of cognitive models. Through the lens of cognitive models of speeded decision-making, we investigated the efficiency of neural data to aid identification of latent cognitive states in models fit to behavioral data. We studied two theoretical frameworks that differed in their assumptions about the composition of the latent generating state. The first assumed that observed performance was generated from a mixture of discrete latent states. The second conceived of the latent state as dynamically varying along a continuous dimension. We used a simulation-based approach to compare recovery of latent data-generating states in neurally-informed versus neurally-uninformed cognitive models. We found that neurally-informed cognitive models were more reliably recovered under a discrete state representation than a continuous dimension representation for medium effect sizes, although recovery was difficult for small sample sizes and moderate noise in neural data. Recovery improved for both representations when a larger effect size differentiated the latent states. We conclude that neural data aids the identification of latent states in cognitive models, but different frameworks for quantitatively informing cognitive models with neural information have different model recovery efficiencies. We provide full worked examples and freely-available code to implement the two theoretical frameworks.},

  abstract = {The sustained attention to response task (SART) has been the primary method of studying the phenomenon of mind wandering. We develop and experimentally test the first integrated cognitive process model that quantitatively explains all stationary features of behavioral performance in the SART. The model assumes that performance is generated by a competitive race between a stimulus-related decision process and a stimulus-unrelated rhythmic response process. We propose that the stimulus-unrelated process entrains to timing regularities in the task environment, and is unconditionally triggered as a habit or ‘insurance policy’ to protect against the deleterious effects of mind wandering on ongoing task performance. For two SART experiments the model provided a quantitatively precise account of a range of previously reported trends in choice, response time and self-reported mind wandering data. It also accounted for three previously unidentified features of response time distributions that place critical constraints on cognitive models of performance in situations when people might engage in task-unrelated thoughts. Furthermore, the parameters of the rhythmic race model were meaningfully associated with participants’ self-reported distraction, even though the model was never informed by these data. In a validation test, we disrupted the latent rhythmic component with a manipulation of inter-trial-interval variability, and showed that the architecture of the model provided insight into its counter-intuitive effect. We conclude that performance in the presence of mind wandering can be conceived as a competitive latent decision vs. rhythmic response process. We discuss how the rhythmic race model is not restricted to the study of distraction or mind wandering; it is applicable to any domain requiring repetitive responding where evidence accumulation is assumed to be an underlying principle of behavior.},

  abstract = {Mind wandering is ubiquitous in everyday life and has a pervasive and profound impact on task-related performance. A range of psychological processes have been proposed to underlie these performance-related decrements, including failures of executive control, volatile information processing, and shortcomings in selective attention to critical task-relevant stimuli. Despite progress in the development of such theories, existing descriptive analyses have limited capacity to discriminate between the theories. We propose a cognitive-model based analysis that simultaneously explains self-reported mind wandering and task performance. We quantitatively compare six explanations of poor performance in the presence of mind wandering. The competing theories are distinguished by whether there is an impact on executive control and, if so, how executive control acts on information processing, and whether there is an impact on volatility of information processing. Across two experiments using the sustained attention to response task, we find quantitative evidence that mind wandering is associated with two latent factors. Our strongest conclusion is that executive control is impaired: increased mind wandering is associated with reduced ability to inhibit habitual response tendencies. Our nuanced conclusion is that executive control deficits manifest in reduced ability to selectively attend to the information value of rare but task-critical events.},

  abstract = {People often "mind wander" during everyday tasks, temporarily losing track of time, place, or current task goals. In laboratory-based tasks, mind wandering is often associated with performance decrements in behavioral variables and changes in neural recordings. Such empirical associations provide descriptive accounts of mind wandering - how it affects ongoing task performance - but fail to provide true explanatory accounts - why it affects task performance. In this perspectives paper, we consider mind wandering as a neural state or process that affects the parameters of quantitative cognitive process models, which in turn affect observed behavioral performance. Our approach thus uses cognitive process models to bridge the explanatory divide between neural and behavioral data. We provide an overview of two general frameworks for developing a model-based cognitive neuroscience of mind wandering. The first approach uses neural data to segment observed performance into a discrete mixture of latent task-related and task-unrelated states, and the second regresses single-trial measures of neural activity onto structured trial-by-trial variation in the parameters of cognitive process models. We discuss the relative merits of the two approaches, and the research questions they can answer, and highlight that both approaches allow neural data to provide additional constraint on the parameters of cognitive models, which will lead to a more precise account of the effect of mind wandering on brain and behavior. We conclude by summarizing prospects for mind wandering as conceived within a model-based cognitive neuroscience framework, highlighting the opportunities for its continued study and the benefits that arise from using well-developed quantitative techniques to study abstract theoretical constructs.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several studies have demonstrated the effect of guided Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT) for depression. However, ICBT is not suitable for all depressed patients and there is a considerable level of nonresponse. Research on predictors and moderators of outcome in ICBT is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: This paper explored predictors of response to an intervention combining the Web-based program MoodGYM and face-to-face therapist guidance in a sample of primary care patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition or to a delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, face-to-face guidance from a psychologist, and reminder emails. In this paper, data from the treatment phase of the 2 groups was merged to increase the sample size (n=82). Outcome was improvement in depressive symptoms during treatment as assessed with the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Predictors included demographic variables, severity variables (eg, number of depressive episodes and pretreatment depression and anxiety severity), cognitive variables (eg, dysfunctional thinking), module completion, and treatment expectancy and motivation. Using Bayesian analysis, predictors of response were explored with a latent-class approach and by analyzing whether predictors affected the slope of response. RESULTS: A 2-class model distinguished well between responders (74\%, 61/82) and nonresponders (26\%, 21/82). Our results indicate that having had more depressive episodes, being married or cohabiting, and scoring higher on a measure of life satisfaction had high odds for positively affecting the probability of response. Higher levels of dysfunctional thinking had high odds for a negative effect on the probability of responding. Prediction of the slope of response yielded largely similar results. Bayes factors indicated substantial evidence that being married or cohabiting predicted a more positive treatment response. The effects of life satisfaction and number of depressive episodes were more uncertain. There was substantial evidence that several variables were unrelated to treatment response, including gender, age, and pretreatment symptoms of depression and anxiety. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment response to ICBT with face-to-face guidance may be comparable across varying levels of depressive severity and irrespective of the presence and severity of comorbid anxiety. Being married or cohabiting, reporting higher life satisfaction, and having had more depressive episodes may predict a more favorable response, whereas higher levels of dysfunctional thinking may be a predictor of poorer response. More studies exploring predictors and moderators of Internet-based treatments are needed to inform for whom this treatment is most effective.

All parameters occurring in the algorithm can be optimized based on the properties of the data and there is a broad regime of parameter configurations where the algorithm produces good results.

Rothermund, Wentura, and De Houwer (2005) explain the effect as a product of a conflict between retrieved and current response. Since specific properties of the involved encoding and retrieval mechanisms were not investigated so far, we extend the response-retrieval framework by asking if encoding during prime processing and retrieval-specific processes during probe processing have a modulating influence on the priming effects. In an overlapping-picture task experiment with an explicit variation of the role of the objects in prime and probe, we reproduce the response-retrieval-specific Response-retrieval × Priming interaction but find a modulation caused by the role of the repeated object in the probe trial. This modulation manifests in a vanishing interaction when the repeated object is a distractor in the probe. We interpret these findings in support of the response-retrieval theory of NP and conclude that the retrieval mechanism is more flexible than previously believed since it is sensitive to relevance of the repeated object regarding the experimental task.

Consistent with empirical findings, novel computational simulations using Burton et al.'s interactive activation and competition model point to a conceptual distinction between how priming is initiated in single- and double-familiarity tasks, indicating that priming should be weaker or non-existent for the single-familiarity task. Experiment 1 demonstrates that, within a double-familiarity framework using famous names, categorical, and associative priming are reliable effects. Pushing the model to the limit, it predicts that pairs of celebrities who are neither associatively nor categorically related but who share single biographical features, both died in a car crash for example, should prime each other. Experiment 2 investigated this in a double-familiarity task but the effect was not observed. We therefore simulated and realized a pairwise learning task that was conceptually similar to the double-familiarity-decision task but allowed to strengthen the underlying connections. Priming based on a single biographical feature could be found both in simulations and the experiment. The effect was not due to visual or name similarity which were controlled for and participants did not report using the biographical links between the people to learn the pairs. The results are interpreted to lend further support to structural models of the memory for persons. Furthermore, the results are consistent with the idea that episodic features known about people are stored in semantic memory and are automatically activated when encountering that person.},

Pupil dilation tracks events that warrant belief updating, likely reflecting the adjustment of neural gain. However, whether subclinical autistic or psychotic symptoms affect this adjustment and how they relate to learning in volatile environments remains to be unraveled. We investigated the relationship between behavioral and pupillometric markers of subjective volatility (i.e., experience of the world as unstable), autistic traits, and psychotic-like experiences in 52 neurotypical adults with a probabilistic reversal learning task. Computational modeling revealed that participants with higher psychotic-like experience scores overestimated volatility in low-volatile task periods. This was not the case for participants scoring high on autistic-like traits, who instead showed a diminished adaptation of choice-switching behavior in response to risk. Pupillometric data indicated that individuals with higher autistic- or psychotic-like trait and experience scores differentiated less between events that warrant belief updating and those that do not when volatility was high. These findings are in line with misestimation of uncertainty accounts of psychosis and autism spectrum disorders and indicate that aberrancies are already present at the subclinical level.},

  abstract = {Background and objectives A plethora of studies has investigated and compared social cognition in autism and schizophrenia ever since both conditions were first described in conjunction more than a century ago. Recent computational theories have proposed similar mechanistic explanations for various symptoms beyond social cognition. They are grounded in the idea of a general misestimation of uncertainty but so far, almost no studies have directly compared both conditions regarding uncertainty processing. The current study aimed to do so with a particular focus on estimation of volatility, i.e. the probability for the environment to change. Methods A probabilistic decision-making task and a visual working (meta-)memory task were administered to a sample of 86 participants (19 with a diagnosis of high-functioning autism, 21 with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and 46 neurotypically developing individuals). Results While persons with schizophrenia showed lower visual working memory accuracy than neurotypical individuals, no significant group differences were found for metamemory or any of the probabilistic decision-making task variables. Nevertheless, exploratory analyses suggest that there may be an overestimation of volatility in subgroups of participants with autism and schizophrenia. Correlations revealed relationships between different variables reflecting (mis)estimation of uncertainty, visual working memory accuracy and metamemory. Limitations Limitations include the comparably small sample sizes of the autism and the schizophrenia group as well as the lack of cognitive ability and clinical symptom measures. Conclusions The results of the current study provide partial support for the notion of a general uncertainty misestimation account of autism and schizophrenia.},

In two experiments we examined whether the features (color, shape) that reappear in consecutive displays, or their level of processing (early-perceptual, late-semantic) moderate the likelihood that stimulus-response associations are retrieved. Using a perceptual matching task (Experiment 1), NP occurred independently of whether responses were repeated or switched. Only when implementing a semantic-matching task (Experiment 2), negative priming was determined by response-repetition as predicted by response-retrieval theory. The results can be explained in terms of a task-dependent temporal discrimination process (Milliken et al., 1998): Response-relevant features are encoded more strongly and/or are more likely to be retrieved than irrelevant features.},

In the cognitive neurosciences, mind wandering has been associated with several distinct neural processes, most notably increased activity in the default mode network (DMN), suppressed activity within the anti-correlated (task-positive) network (ACN), and changes in neuromodulation. By using an integrative multimodal approach combining machine-learning techniques with modeling of latent cognitive processes, we show that mind wandering in humans is characterized by inefficiencies in executive control (task-monitoring) processes. This failure is predicted by a single-trial signature of (co)activations in the DMN, ACN, and neuromodulation, and accompanied by a decreased rate of evidence accumulation and response thresholds in the cognitive model.},

  abstract = {Mind wandering (MW) is a heterogeneous construct involving task-unrelated thoughts. Recently, the interest in modulating MW propensity via non-invasive brain stimulation techniques has increased. Single-session transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in healthy controls has led to mixed results in modulating MW propensity, possibly due to methodological heterogeneity. Therefore, our aim was to conduct a systematic meta-analysis to examine the influence of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (lDLPFC) and right inferior parietal lobule (rIPL) targeted tDCS on MW propensity. Importantly, by computational modeling of tDCS-induced electric fields, we accounted for differences in tDCS-dose across studies that varied strongly in their applied methodology. Fifteen single-session, sham-controlled tDCS studies published until October 2021 were included. All studies involved healthy adult participants and used cognitive tasks combined with MW thought-probes. Heterogeneity in tDCS electrode placement, stimulation polarity and intensity were controlled for by means of electric field simulations, while overall methodological quality was assessed via an extended risk of bias (RoB) assessment. We found that RoB was the strongest predictor of study outcomes. Moreover, the rIPL was the most promising cortical area for influencing MW, with stronger anodal electric fields in this region being negatively associated with MW propensity. Electric field strength in the lDLPFC was not related to MW propensity. We identified several severe methodological problems that could have contributed to overestimated effect sizes in this literature, an issue that needs urgent attention in future research in this area. Overall, there is no reliable evidence for tDCS influencing MW in the healthy. However, the analysis also revealed that increasing neural excitability in the rIPL via tDCS might be associated with reduced MW propensity. In an exploratory approach, we also found some indication that targeting prefrontal regions outside the lDLPFC with tDCS could lead to increased MW propensity.},

In healthy individuals, inter-individual differences in brain anatomy significantly influence current distribution during tDCS, an effect that might be aggravated by variations in cortical atrophy in AD patients. Objective: To measure the effect of individualized HD-tDCS in AD patients. Methods: Nineteen AD patients were randomly assigned to receive active or sham high-definition tDCS (HD-tDCS). Computational modeling of the HD-tDCS-induced electric field in each patient’s brain was analyzed based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The chosen montage provided the highest net anodal electric field in the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). An accelerated HD-tDCS design was conducted (2 mA for 3 x 20 min) on two separate days. Pre- and post-intervention cognitive tests and T1 and T2-weighted MRI and diffusion tensor imaging data at baseline were analyzed. Results: Different montages were optimal for individual patients. The active HD-tDCS group improved significantly in delayed memory and MMSE performance compared to the sham group. Five participants in the active group had higher scores on delayed memory post HD-tDCS, four remained stable and one declined. The active HD-tDCS group had a significant positive correlation between fractional anisotropy in the anterior thalamic radiation and delayed memory score. Conclusion: HD-tDCS significantly improved delayed memory in AD. Our study can be regarded as a proof-of-concept attempt to increase tDCS efficacy. The present findings should be confirmed in larger samples.},

Our holistic approach enhances the depiction of various visual cues, including gradients from surface shading, surface reflectance, shadows, and highlights, to ease estimation of viewpoint, lighting conditions, shapes of objects and their world-space organization. Motivated by recent perceptual findings on 3D aspects of the Cornsweet illusion, we create scene coherent enhancements by treating cues in terms of their 3D context; doing so has a stronger effect than approaches that operate in a 2D image context and also achieves temporal coherence. We validate our unsharp masking in 3D with psychophysical experiments showing that the enhanced images are perceived to have better contrast and are preferred over unenhanced originals. Our operator runs at real-time rates on a GPU and the effect is easily controlled interactively within the rendering pipeline.},

  abstract = {Abstract Glare is a consequence of light scattered within the human eye when looking at bright light sources. This effect can be exploited for tone mapping since adding glare to the depiction of high-dynamic range (HDR) imagery on a low-dynamic range (LDR) medium can dramatically increase perceived contrast. Even though most, if not all, subjects report perceiving glare as a bright pattern that fluctuates in time, up to now it has only been modeled as a static phenomenon. We argue that the temporal properties of glare are a strong means to increase perceived brightness and to produce realistic and attractive renderings of bright light sources. Based on the anatomy of the human eye, we propose a model that enables real-time simulation of dynamic glare on a GPU. This allows an improved depiction of HDR images on LDR media for interactive applications like games, feature films, or even by adding movement to initially static HDR images. By conducting psychophysical studies, we validate that our method improves perceived brightness and that dynamic glare-renderings are often perceived as more attractive depending on the chosen scene.},

The reduction of the reaction time observed in positive priming is well-known and experimentally understood (Scarborough et al., J. Exp. Psycholol: Hum. Percept. Perform., 3, pp. 1–17, 1977). Negative priming—the opposite effect—is experimentally less tangible (Fox, Psychonom. Bull. Rev., 2, pp. 145–173, 1995). The dependence on subtle parameter changes (such as response-stimulus interval) usually varies. The sensitivity of the negative priming effect bears great potential for applications in research in fields such as memory, selective attention, and ageing effects. We develop and analyse a computational realization, CISAM, of a recent psychological model for action decision making, the ISAM (Kabisch, PhD thesis, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität, 2003), which is sensitive to priming conditions. With the dynamical systems approach of the CISAM, we show that a single adaptive threshold mechanism is sufficient to explain both positive and negative priming effects. This is achieved by comparing results obtained by the computational modelling with experimental data from our laboratory. The implementation provides a rich base from which testable predictions can be derived, e.g. with respect to hitherto untested stimulus combinations (e.g. single-object trials).},

We argue that most NP studies confound priming and perceptual similarity of prime-probe episodes and implement a color-switch paradigm in order to resolve the issue. In a series of three identity negative priming experiments with verbal naming response, we determined when NP and positive priming (PP) occur during a trial. The first experiment assessed the impact of target color on priming effects. It consisted of two blocks, each with a different fixed target color. With respect to target color no differential priming effects were found. In Experiment 2 the target color was indicated by a cue for each trial. Here we resolved the confounding of perceptual similarity and priming condition. In trials with coinciding colors for prime and probe, we found priming effects similar to Experiment 1. However, trials with a target color switch showed such effects only in trials with role-reversal (distractor-to-target or target-to-distractor), whereas the positive priming (PP) effect in the target-repetition trials disappeared. Finally, Experiment 3 split trial processing into two phases by presenting the trial-wise color cue only after the stimulus objects had been recognized. We found recognition in every priming condition to be faster than in control trials. We were hence led to the conclusion that PP is strongly affected by perception, in contrast to NP which emerges during selection, i.e., the two effects cannot be explained by a single mechanism.},

  abstract = {Pavlovian bias is an innate motivational tendency to approach rewards and remain passive in the face of punishment. The relative reliance on Pavlovian valuation has been found to increase when the perceived control over environmental reinforcers is compromised, leading to behavior resembling learned helplessness (LH). In our study, we used a version of an orthogonalized Go-NoGo reinforcement learning task to examine the relative reliance on Pavlovian and instrumental valuation during and after an intermittent loss of control over rewards and losses. Sixty healthy young adults underwent the task and received anodal high-definition transcranial direct current stimulation (HD-tDCS) over the medial prefrontal/ dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study. Furthermore, we evaluated changes in cue-locked mid-frontal theta power derived from electroencephalography. We hypothesized that active stimulation would reduce Pavlovian bias during manipulation of outcome controllability, and the effect would be accompanied by stronger mid-frontal theta activity, representing arbitration between choice strategies in favor of instrumental relative to Pavlovian valuation. We found a progressive decrease in Pavlovian bias during and after the loss of control over feedback. Active HD-tDCS counteracted this effect while not affecting the mid-frontal theta signal. The results were at odds with our hypotheses but also with previous findings reporting LH-like patterns during and after the loss of control without brain stimulation. The discrepancy may be related to different protocols for the controllability manipulation. We argue that the subjective evaluation of task controllability is crucial in mediating the balance between Pavlovian and instrumental valuation during reinforcement learning and that the medial prefrontal/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex is a key region in this respect. These findings have implications for understanding the behavioral and neural underpinnings of LH in humans.},

While most stimulators are capable of operating in double-blind mode, the amount of discomfort experienced during tDCS may break blinding. Therefore, specifically designed sham stimulation protocols are being used. The “fade-in, short-stimulation, fade-out” (FSF) protocol has been used in hundreds of studies and is commonly believed to be indistinguishable from real stimulation applied at 1 mA for 20 min. We analysed subjective reports of 192 volunteers, who either received real tDCS (n = 96) or FSF tDCS (n = 96). Participants reported more discomfort for real tDCS and correctly guessed the condition above chance-level. These findings indicate that FSF does not ensure complete blinding and that better active sham protocols are needed.},

Understanding the generation of these cognitive placebo/nocebo effects is crucial for evaluating the cognitive impacts of interventional methods, such as non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS). We report both cognitive placebo and nocebo effects on reward-based learning performance induced using an active sham NIBS protocol, verbal suggestions and conditioning in 80 healthy participants. Whereas our placebo manipulation increased both expected and perceived cognitive performance, nocebo had a detrimental effect on both. Model-based analysis suggests manipulation-specific strategic adjustments in learning-rates: Participants in the placebo group showed stronger learning from losses and reduced behavioral noise, participants in the nocebo group showed~stronger learning from gains and increased behavioral noise. We conclude that experimentally induced expectancy can impact cognitive functions of healthy adult participants. This has important implications for the use of double-blind study designs that can effectively maintain blinding in NIBS studies.},

Reward-based learning processes, such as reinforcement learning, involves a large part of the DA-ergic network that is also activated by the placebo intervention. Given the neurochemical overlap between placebo and reward learning, we investigated whether verbal instructions in conjunction with a placebo intervention are capable of enhancing reward learning in healthy individuals by using a monetary reward-based reinforcement-learning task. Placebo intervention was performed with non-invasive brain stimulation techniques. In a randomized, triple-blind, cross-over study we investigated this cognitive placebo effect in healthy individuals by manipulating the participants' perceived uncertainty about the intervention's efficacy. Volunteers in the purportedly low- and high-uncertainty conditions earned more money, responded more quickly and had a higher learning rate from monetary rewards relative to baseline. Participants in the purportedly high-uncertainty conditions showed enhanced reward learning, and a model-free computational analysis revealed a higher learning rate from monetary rewards compared to the purportedly low-uncertainty and baseline conditions. Our results indicate that the placebo response is able to enhance reward learning in healthy individuals, opening up exciting avenues for future research in placebo effects on other cognitive functions.},

  abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is an increasingly used, non-invasive brain stimulation technique in neuroscience research and clinical practice with a broad spectrum of suggested applications. Among other parameters, the choice of stimulus intensity and intracranial electric field strength substantially impacts rTMS outcome. This review provides a systematic overview of the intensity selection approaches and stimulation intensities used in human rTMS studies. We also examined whether studies report sufficient information to reproduce stimulus intensities for basic science research models. We performed a systematic review by focusing on original studies published between 1991 and 2020. We included conventional (e.g., 1 or 10 Hz) and patterned protocols (e.g., continuous or intermittent theta burst stimulation). We identified 3,784 articles in total, and we manually processed a representative portion (20\%) of randomly selected articles. The majority of the analyzed studies (90\% of entries) used the motor threshold (MT) approach and stimulation intensities from 80\% to 120\% of the MT. For continuous and intermittent theta burst stimulation, the most frequent stimulation intensity was 80\% of the active MT. Most studies (92\% of entries) did not report sufficient information to reproduce the stimulation intensity. Only a minority of studies (1.03\% of entries) estimated the rTMS-induced electric field strengths. We formulate easy-to-follow recommendations to help scientists and clinicians report relevant information on stimulation intensity. Future standardized reporting guidelines may facilitate the use of basic science approaches aiming at better understanding the molecular, cellular, and neuronal mechanisms of rTMS.},

  abstract = {Cognitive control is a mental process, which underlies adaptive goal-directed decisions. Previous studies have linked cognitive control to electrophysiological fluctuations in the theta band and theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling (CFC) arising from the cingulate and frontal cortices. Yet, to date the behavioral consequences of different forms of theta-gamma CFC remain elusive. Here, we studied the behavioral effects of the theta-gamma CFC via transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) designed to stimulate the frontal and cingulate cortices in humans. Using a double-blind, randomized, repeated measures study design, 24 healthy participants were subjected to three active and one control CFC-tACS conditions. In the active conditions, 80 Hz gamma tACS was coupled to 4 Hz theta tACS. Specifically, in two of the active conditions, short gamma bursts were coupled to the delivered theta cycle to coincide with either its peaks or troughs. In the third active condition, the phase of a theta cycle modulated the amplitude of the gamma oscillation. In the fourth, control protocol, 80 Hz tACS was continuously superimposed over the 4 Hz tACS, therefore lacking any phase-specificity in the CFC. During the 20-minute of stimulation, the participants performed a Go/NoGo monetary reward- and punishment-based instrumental learning task. A Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that relative to the control, the peak-coupled tACS had no effects on the behavioral performance, whereas the trough-coupled tACS and, to a lesser extent, amplitude-modulated tACS reduced performance in conflicting trials. Our results suggest that cognitive control depends on the phase-specificity of the theta-gamma CFC. Statement of significance This study investigated the behavioral effects of different forms of theta-gamma cross-frequency coupling in cognitive control. To this aim, we delivered cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation over the cingulate and frontal cortices in humans. We found that when gamma tACS was coupled to the trough of theta tACS, the stimulation worsened the ability of healthy participants to employ cognitive control. Our findings highlight the role of theta-gamma cross frequency coupling in complex goal-directed behavior in humans.},

METHODS: To evaluate the role of the prefrontal cortex in instrumental learning, we applied anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) optimized for the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, by using realistic MR-derived finite element model-based electric field simulations. In a study with a double-blind, sham-controlled, repeated-measures design, sixteen male participants performed a probabilistic learning task while receiving anodal and sham tDCS in a counterbalanced order. RESULTS: Compared to sham tDCS, anodal tDCS significantly increased the amount of maladaptive shifting behavior after optimal outcomes during learning when reward probabilities were highly dissociable. Derived parameters of the Q-learning computational model further revealed a significantly increased model parameter that was sensitive to random action selection in the anodal compared to the sham tDCS session, whereas the learning rate parameter was not influenced significantly by tDCS. CONCLUSION: These results congruently indicate that prefrontal tDCS during instrumental learning increased randomness of choice, possibly reflecting the influence of the cognitive prefrontal component.},

We conducted two separate experiments in which we applied rTMS over the left parietal-occipital region. Prospective electric field simulation guided the choice of the individual stimulation intensities. In the main experiment, 16 participants received rhythmic and arrhythmic rTMS bursts at between ca. 20 and 50 mv/mm peak absolute electric field intensities. In the control experiment, another group of 16 participants received sham rTMS. To characterize the aftereffects, we estimated the alpha power (8–14~Hz) changes recorded in the inter-burst intervals, i.e., from 0.2 to 10~s after rTMS. We found aftereffects lasting up to two seconds after stimulation with ca. 35~mV/mm. Relative to baseline, alpha power was significantly reduced by the arrhythmic protocol, while there was no significant change with the rhythmic protocol. We found no significant long-term, i.e., up to 10-second, differences between the rhythmic and arrhythmic stimulation, or between the rhythmic and sham protocols. Weak arrhythmic rTMS induced short-lived alpha suppression during the inter-burst intervals.},

  abstract = {Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a potent tool for modulating endogenous oscillations in humans. The current standard method for rTMS defines the stimulation intensity based on the evoked liminal response in the visual or motor system (e.g., resting motor threshold). The key limitation of the current approach is that the magnitude of the resulting electric field remains elusive. A better characterization of the electric field strength induced by a given rTMS protocol is necessary in order to improve the understanding of the neural mechanisms of rTMS. In this study we used a novel approach, in which individualized prospective computational modeling of the induced electric field guided the choice of stimulation intensity. We consistently found that rhythmic rTMS protocols increased neural synchronization in the posterior alpha frequency band when measured simultaneously with scalp electroencephalography. We observed this effect already at electric field strengths of roughly half the lowest conventional field strength, which is 80\% of the resting motor threshold. We conclude that rTMS can induce immediate electrophysiological effects at much weaker electric field strengths than previously thought.},
