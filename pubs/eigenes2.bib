	abstract = {Priming is characterized by a sensitivity of reaction times to the sequence of stimuli in psychophysical experiments. The reduction of the reaction time observed in positive priming is well-known and experimentally understood (Scarborough et al., J. Exp. Psycholol: Hum. Percept. Perform., 3, pp. 1–17, 1977). Negative priming—the opposite effect—is experimentally less tangible (Fox, Psychonom. Bull. Rev., 2, pp. 145–173, 1995). The dependence on subtle parameter changes (such as response-stimulus interval) usually varies. The sensitivity of the negative priming effect bears great potential for applications in research in fields such as memory, selective attention, and ageing effects. We develop and analyse a computational realization, CISAM, of a recent psychological model for action decision making, the ISAM (Kabisch, PhD thesis, Friedrich-Schiller-Universität, 2003), which is sensitive to priming conditions. With the dynamical systems approach of the CISAM, we show that a single adaptive threshold mechanism is sufficient to explain both positive and negative priming effects. This is achieved by comparing results obtained by the computational modelling with experimental data from our laboratory. The implementation provides a rich base from which testable predictions can be derived, e.g. with respect to hitherto untested stimulus combinations (e.g. single-object trials).},

	abstract = {We present a new approach for enhancing local scene contrast by unsharp masking over arbitrary surfaces under any form of illumination. Our adaptation of a well-known 2D technique to 3D interactive scenarios is designed to aid viewers in tasks like understanding complex or detailed geometric models, medical visualization and navigation in virtual environments. Our holistic approach enhances the depiction of various visual cues, including gradients from surface shading, surface reflectance, shadows, and highlights, to ease estimation of viewpoint, lighting conditions, shapes of objects and their world-space organization. Motivated by recent perceptual findings on 3D aspects of the Cornsweet illusion, we create scene coherent enhancements by treating cues in terms of their 3D context; doing so has a stronger effect than approaches that operate in a 2D image context and also achieves temporal coherence. We validate our unsharp masking in 3D with psychophysical experiments showing that the enhanced images are perceived to have better contrast and are preferred over unenhanced originals. Our operator runs at real-time rates on a GPU and the effect is easily controlled interactively within the rendering pipeline.},

	abstract = {The role of the default-mode network (DMN) in the emergence of mind wandering and task-unrelated thought has been studied extensively. In parallel work, mind wandering has been associated with neuromodulation via the locus coeruleus (LC) norepinephrine (LC-NE) system. Here we propose a neural model that links the two systems in an integrative framework. The model attempts to explain how dynamic changes in brain systems give rise to the subjective experience of mind wandering. The model implies a neural and conceptual distinction between an off-focus state and an active mind-wandering state and provides a potential neural grounding for well-known cognitive theories of mind wandering. Finally, the proposed neural model of mind wandering generates precise, testable predictions at neural and behavioral levels.},
