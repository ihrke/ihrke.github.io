## About me


I am a professor at the University of Troms√∏. My main
interests within the field of cognitive neuroscience are mind wandering, non-invasive brain stimulation, decision making, pupillometry and selective attention. I am also interested in the development of methodological approaches in my field and enjoy computational methods, cognitive modeling, machine-learning and Bayesian statistics.
