Setup for sharing org-mode agenda with google calendar (and mobile devices)
===========================================================================

Note: this is only one-directional from org-mode to google calendar.

First step: setup org-mode to export all the agenda-files to an ics file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put this into the .emacs file (I save the agenda to dropbox).

``` {.sourceCode .elisp}
(setq org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file "~/Dropbox/orgfiles/org.ics")
(setq org-icalendar-include-todo '(all))
(setq org-icalendar-use-scheduled '(event-if-todo event-if-not-todo)) 
(setq org-icalendar-use-deadline '(event-if-todo event-if-not-todo))

;; this hook saves an ics file once an org-buffer is saved
(defun my-icalendar-agenda-export()
    (if (string= (file-name-extension (buffer-file-name)) "org")
              (org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files)) 
      )
(add-hook 'after-save-hook 'my-icalendar-agenda-export)
```

Second: share in dropbox
------------------------

In your dropbox folder on the web, click on share and \"get link\".

This links looks like this:
<https://www.dropbox.com/s/randomletters/org.ics>

Replace www with dl such that it looks like this:
<https://dl.dropbox.com/s/randomletters/org.ics>

Third: add by url in google-calendar
------------------------------------

This is unfortunately not as straight-forward as I would like to belive.
Google calendar allows to \"Add by url\" (in the left panel, under
\"Other calendars\"). However, with dropbox-links this fails with some
warning about \"robots.txt\".

There is the following workaround (thanks to this
[discussion](https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/calendar/HYN1y-7GYu4)).
You have to create a
[pipe](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.info?_id=1f85c5a9c2af3c8768d342531f5ca528),
then abbreviate the url with [tinyurl](http://www.tinyurl.com) and
finally import the resulting link into google-calendar (works fine this
time).

Last: subscribe to the new google calendar on your devices

e.g., mobile phone, mac, thunderbird (lightning),\...
