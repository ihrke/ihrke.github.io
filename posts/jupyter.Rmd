Multi-Language IPython (Jupyter) setup
======================================

The IPython notebook project (which I adore) is about to be renamed to
[Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to better reflect the fact that it can be
used with other languages besides Python. At the moment that is under
heavy development and probably quite unstable but I found myself aching
for an IR-Notebook. So here is a guide to set up a multi-language
Jupyter notebook (meaning that you just start the server and can select
if you want an R-Notebook, a Python-notebook, or one of the other
availabel
[kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython%20kernels%20for%20other%20languages)).

Note that the instructions on this page are likely to break since they
depend on early development versions of the different packages. I expect
that the whole procedure is going to be faciliated/documented once the
Jupyter project gets going.

At first, we set up a bleeding-edge ipython (this is from a bare bones
python installation):

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
# setup pip
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py  
sudo python get-pip.py

# make a virtualenv
sudo pip install virtualenv
cd ~
virtualenv local/python/jupyter
source local/python/jupyter/bin/activate

## get the cutting edge ipython version
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git
# and install all its dependencies
cd ipython
pip install -e ".[notebook]" 
```

You can run the notebook with

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ipython notebook
```

while you are in the virtualenv. Stay in the virtualenv for the rest of
the setup.

Adding R
--------

For adding R-support, you need the experimental
[IRKernel](https://github.com/takluyver/IRkernel). Just follow the
instructions in the \`README\`:

Install dependencies:

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
sudo apt-get install libzmq3-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
```

fire up R and

``` {.sourceCode .R}
install.packages("devtools")
# Need RCurl for install_github
install.packages('RCurl')
library(devtools)
install_github('armstrtw/rzmq')
install_github("takluyver/IRdisplay")
install_github("takluyver/IRkernel")
IRkernel::installspec() 
```

In my case the last line failed with permission problems. The code of
[IRkernel::installspec]{.title-ref} is as follows:

``` {.sourceCode .R}
function () 
{
     srcdir = system.file("kernelspec", package = "IRkernel")
     cmd = paste("ipython kernelspec install --replace --name ir", 
           srcdir, sep = " ")
     system(cmd, wait = TRUE)
}
```

so the function basically makes a system call to [ipython
kernelspec]{.title-ref} to install the kernel that is located in
[srcdir]{.title-ref}. You can find out the value of [srcdir]{.title-ref}
by running the first line of the function

``` {.sourceCode .R}
print(system.file("kernelspec", package = "IRkernel"))
```

(in my case the path was
[/home/mittner/R/x86\_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.1/IRkernel/kernelspec]{.title-ref}).

Now exit R and run the command by hand (supplemented by \"\--user\" to
install the kernel in the users directory instead of globally \-- that
was what caused the permission problem):

``` {.sourceCode .bash}
ipython kernelspec install --replace --name ir --user /home/mittner/R/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-library/3.1/IRkernel/kernelspec
```

Now fire up the notebook and voila:

and by creating an R-notebook, you have the RNotebook:

Finally, it\'s possible to add more
[kernels](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/IPython%20kernels%20for%20other%20languages)
for example for [Julia](http://julialang.org/) in a similar way.
