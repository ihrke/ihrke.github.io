This is a living document and I will add to it as I change things or encounter issues.

I recently got a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 11 with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed
and decided to install Opensuse Tumbleweed on it. Here are some notes on my 
setup and tweaks I did to get it to work the way I wanted. I use [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/)
as my window manager so much of it will concern this setup.

My needs are that of a university professor, i.e., I need to interact with colleagues
using Microsoft products etc., I need to write papers, do data analysis, and run simulations.

## Hardware

Most things just worked out of the box.

## Partitioning

I separated `/home` and made a separate boot partition. I also made a swap partition with 50GB for hibernation etc.

```bash
$ df -h

Filesystem      Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
/dev/nvme0n1p2  196G   20G  166G  11% /
/dev/nvme0n1p4  1.6T  507G  1.1T  33% /home
/dev/nvme0n1p1  500M  5.8M  494M   2% /boot/efi
```

```bash
$ cat /proc/swaps

Filename				Type		Size		Used		Priority
/dev/nvme0n1p3                          partition	52428796	2048		-2
```

## Desktop

I use [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/) with [waybar](https://github.com/Alexays/Waybar) as the status bar. I only recommend this for relatively experienced Linux users, there is a lot of tweaking necessary to it to get it to work the way you want. 

- [Hyprland website](https://hyprland.org/)
- [Hyprland docs](https://wiki.hyprland.org/)
- [Monitors](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/)
- [Hotkeys](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Binds/)

I like it, because it is very fast and does not come with all the GNOME/KDE clutter, yet it is easy to configure. Most configuration files are under `~/.config/hypr`. To install it, I added the repository

```bash
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:Wayland/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/X11:Wayland.repo
zypper refresh
zypper install hyprland waybar hyprpaper hyprlock
```

Also, Hyprland can be "remote controlled" through a tool called `hyprctl` which is very useful.

My config files are here: <https://github.com/ihrke/dotfiles>

### Application switcher

I use [wofi](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi). This is the script I fixed up to use it with Hyprland: <https://github.com/ihrke/dotfiles/blob/main/hypr/scripts/window_switcher.sh>.

### Switching keyboard languages

I regularly work with multiple languages and wanted a quick way to switch between them.

I added a custom block to the [waybar config file](https://github.com/ihrke/dotfiles/blob/main/waybar/config):

```bash
   "custom/layout": {
        "exec": "~/.config/waybar/modules/kblayout.sh",
        "interval": 1,
        "format": "{} ï„œ"
    }
```
This block calls a script [`~/.config/waybar/modules/kblayout.sh`](https://github.com/ihrke/dotfiles/blob/main/waybar/modules/kblayout.sh).


### Media keys

I added the following to [`hyprland.conf`](https://github.com/ihrke/dotfiles/blob/main/hypr/hyprland.conf) to control the volume with the media keys:

```bash
bindel=, XF86AudioRaiseVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 6%+
bindel=, XF86AudioLowerVolume, exec, wpctl set-volume @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ 5%-
bindl=, XF86AudioMute, exec, wpctl set-mute @DEFAULT_AUDIO_SINK@ toggle
```

## Specific software

### E-mail software

I use Thunderbird as my e-mail client but want to be able to accept invitations
through the MS Office 365 system. It kind of works through the "Owl" plugin [Owl for Exchange](https://addons.thunderbird.net/en-US/thunderbird/addon/owl-for-exchange/) (I installed
it and payed the fee which is around 10 EUR a year - I hate subscriptions, so I 
made sure to stop the subscription at once after the payment). I am not super happy with the
functionality as I had some trouble with accepting invitations etc. Also, it does not
seem to support multiple calendars on the O365 account as well as managing delegate 
calendars. I therefore also use the web interface for outlook at <https://outlook.office.com/mail/>.

### Cisco VPN client

Installation of the Linux client went without any problems, however, I could not 
connect to our VPN server because `vpnagentd` was not running. 

The client is installed into 

```bash
/opt/cisco/secureclient
```
and the GUI can be started with

```bash
/opt/cisco/secureclient/bin/vpnui
```
The configuration for `vpnagentd` is in 
```bash
/etc/systemd/system/vpnagent.service
```

I followed advice from [this blog post](https://www.reddit.com/r/openSUSE/comments/112tr3d/comment/j8mxe3t/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).

To make the `vpnagentd` agent start, I had to change a setting in `/opt/cisco/secureclient/AnyConnectLocalPolicy.xml`:
```bash
<BypassDownloader>true</BypassDownloader>
```
and edit `/etc/systemd/system/vpnagent.service` and change `EnvironmentFile=/etc/environment`
to `EnvironmentFile=-/etc/environment` (the minus sign ignores the file if it does not exist - it doesn't on openSUSE TW).

After that, I could start the service with
```bash
sudo systemctl start vpnagentd
```
You can check the status with
```bash
sudo systemctl status vpnagentd
```

### RStudio

There was an issue when using the latest RStudio version downloaded from <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> (there is an `rpm` intended for OpenSuse 15). It did not start but complained about a missing version of OpenSSL. I had to install `sudo zypper install libopenssl1_1` to make it work. 

### Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and it works perfectly on Linux. The only issue I had was getting it to sync with my iPhone. Before, when using a MacBook, I was syncing through iCloud which worked perfectly. On Linux, I was not able to find a syncing client for iCloud that I trusted and I therefore decided to use Dropbox. Unfortunately, the iPhone app cannot directly work on the Dropbox folder and I had to use a plugin called [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) which syncs the Obsidian vault from the iPhone to a Dropbox folder. 

On Linux, I simply use the vault synced to by this plugin (it is under `/Apps/Obsidian/<my-vault>`) directly. This setup seems to work without hickups, so far. Under the plugin settings, I had to turn on "sync on open" and "sync on save" to make it work.


## Tweaks

### Get back `/var/log/messages`

```bash
sudo zypper install rsyslog
```
