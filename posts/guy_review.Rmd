I am happy to announce that our review paper on a model-based cognitive
neuroscience approach to the study of mind-wandering has been accepted
for publication in [Neuroscience](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/neuroscience/), (Hawkins et al., accepted).
This paper summarizes many of the theoretical ideas that we have been
discussing in our group for quite some time and also reviews and
integrates the research done so far. Actually, the number of research
papers actually using cognitive process models to investigate mind
wandering has been quite rare (e.g., Bastian & Sackgur, 2013) and our [own paper](/post/2015/06/23/commentary-on-our-mind-wandering-paper/),
(Mittner et al., 2014) but there are a few instances where we can reinterpret
the results in terms of mind wandering. I am really excited about the
regression-based approach that is outlined in the paper and we are
working on implementing this kind of model at the moment. Expect more in
that direction soon!
