New paper (open data!): Association Between Executive Functions, Working Memory, and Manual Dexterity
=====================================================================================================

I am thrilled to see that our fully-Bayesian, open-data paper
\"Association Between Executive Functions, Working Memory, and Manual
Dexterity in Young and Healthy Older Adults\" has been published in
[Perceptual & Motor Skills](http://www.amsciepub.com/loi/pms). 
This paper takes on the rarely asked question about the
relationship between cognitive functions and manual dexterity. The
history of my involvement with this manuscript is maybe unusual in that
one of the reviewers actually requested the use of Bayesian statistics
(because he felt that the analyses reported in an initial version of the
MS in which I was not involved were not appropriate). I was, of course,
all too happy to help and our efforts have resulted in a fully-Bayesian
paper.

I have recently started to think about openness of data and materials to
the scientific community. Ever since it\'s initiation, I have been a fan
of Richard Morey\'s [Peer Reviewers\' Openness
Initiative](http://opennessinitiative.org/) and I have recently
[signed](https://opennessinitiative.org/signatories/) the initiative
(you should do so, too!). At the time of this writing, there are already
278 people who have committed to require that data and experimental
materials are made openly available before reviewing a paper. Obviously,
making such a commitment requires that I also follow these rules in my
own research! So far, I have not done so (shame on me!), mostly for
practical reasons (publishing large fMRI data is difficult;
anonymization not trivial; documentation of the datasets time-consuming
etc, etc) even though I was always committed to give out data/materials
when requested (we signed a declaration in my old lab). However, I do
see the difference between agreeing to handing out data and putting it
up on the web for anyone to look at. How often did I not wish to have
easy access to the data published in scientific articles (for research,
teaching and sometimes just for fun)! I have therefore decided to
implement an open-data policy and upload all data per-default upon
publication.

Given that usually many co-authors are involved in most research
projects, it is not always easy to convince everyone to go along with
these requirements. I am happy that my co-authors on our new paper
[Claudia
Rodriguez-Aranda](https://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=42307&p_dimension_id=88120)
and [Olena
Vasylenko](https://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=256295&p_dimension_id=88120)
from the [Research group \"Behavioral neuroscience and human
development\"](https://en.uit.no/forskning/forskningsgrupper/gruppe?p_document_id=345695)
readily agreed to share their hard-won data with anyone who can use a
computer to download files. The data and all analysis scripts (R + Stan)
are available from
[github](https://github.com/ihrke/2016-executive-functions-manual-dexterity).
