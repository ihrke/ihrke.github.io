This is a living document and I will add to it as I change things or encounter issues.

I recently got a Lenovo Thinkpad X1 Carbon Gen 12 with Ubuntu Linux pre-installed (my 
old Gen 11 was stolen, see my experience of using Linux on it [here](linux_on_thinpad_x1_carbon_gen11.qmd)).
This time I decided to stick with the installed Ubuntu and see how far it would fulfill my needs.

I updated the installed Ubuntu version to the most recent one 24.10 (Oracular) using Ubuntu's upgrading system (worked just fine).


My needs are that of a university professor, i.e., I need to interact with colleagues
using Microsoft products etc., I need to write papers, do data analysis, and run simulations.

## Hardware

Most things just worked out of the box.

### Fingerprint reader

works perfectly out of the box

```bash
# install fprintd et al
$ sudo apt install fprintd*
# save and verify that the scan works
$ fprintd-enroll -f right-index-finger
$ fprintd-verify 
```



## Desktop


I tried [Budgie](https://ubuntubudgie.org/) and [Unity](https://ubuntuunity.org/) but ended up using the pre-installed [Gnome](https://www.gnome.org/). The other desktops were buggy and I had issues with the scaling of the screen, supporting multiple screens etc. While I am not a big fan of the new Gnome shell, I can tweak it so that I can live with it for now.

## Specific software

### E-mail software

The [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution) has improved a lot since last time I tried. In fact, I am now able to access my University Exchange (Office 365) accounts and can even see all the calendar events, invitations and even delegates! Evolution is per now the only software that allows that (I have tried many!). 

The user interface (especially for the calendar) is very rough and ugly but for now functionality beats looks! I like Thunderbirds' interface much better but it does not support the calendar functionality I need (I even tried the paid Owl plugin but it supports only one account and is limited in its support for e.g., delegates). It seems that Thunderbird is working on finally implementing the Exchange protocol, so I will keep an eye on that.

### RStudio

There was an issue when using the latest RStudio version downloaded from <https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/> and it would not start. I found a workaround and adding

```bash
$ rstudio --no-sandbox
```

works.

### Obsidian

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for note-taking and it works perfectly on Linux. The only issue I had was getting it to sync with my iPhone. Before, when using a MacBook, I was syncing through iCloud which worked perfectly. On Linux, I was not able to find a syncing client for iCloud that I trusted and I therefore decided to use Dropbox. Unfortunately, the iPhone app cannot directly work on the Dropbox folder and I had to use a plugin called [Remotely Save](https://github.com/remotely-save/remotely-save) which syncs the Obsidian vault from the iPhone to a Dropbox folder. 

On Linux, I simply use the vault synced to by this plugin (it is under `/Apps/Obsidian/<my-vault>`) directly. This setup seems to work without hickups, so far. Under the plugin settings, I had to turn on "sync on open" and "sync on save" to make it work.

### Drop-down terminal

I tried [guake](https://github.com/Guake/guake) but it did not work properly with the global keyboard shortcut. I have switched to the GNOME-extension [ddterm](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3780/ddterm/) which is great.


### PsychoPy

I use [psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) for running experiments and installing it on Ubuntu 24.10 took a bit of tinkering to get the version numbers right.

I started with the straight-forward commands provided on the [psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/download.html) website:

```bash
$ conda create -n psychopy python=3.10
$ conda activate psychopy
$ pip install psychopy # this should complete without errors
```

This worked but I could not start an experiment, getting an error message that a symbol from `libstdc++.so.6` was missing. The following command installs the right version into the active conda environment:

```bash
$ conda install -c conda-forge libstdcxx-ng
```

Next, I got a problem with the incorrect version of `Qt6` (on Ubuntu, the most recent version was 6.6 but psychopy required 6.7). I had to install the correct version using:

```bash
$ conda install "conda-forge::qt6-main==6.7.3"
```

(it has to be *exactly* 6.7.3).

Next, there was a weird error complaining about a missing symbol in some library that had to do with Wayland. I started my desktop into Xorg mode and the error disappeared. Weirdly, after that, I could start the experiment in Wayland mode as well (shrug).

## Tweaks

### Get back `/var/log/messages`

It is now in `/var/log/syslog`:

```bash
sudo ln -s /var/log/syslog /var/log/messages
```

### Resize windows with right mouse button

This is something I have become very familiar with and would not like to miss. Installing `dconf-editor` and changing the setting under `org.gnome.desktop.wm.preferences` to `resize-with-right-button` does the trick.

### Fingerprint authentication (lid close)

Using the fingerprint reader is very easy and can be configured using 

```
$ sudo pam-auth-update
```

I often use the laptop with lid closed and two external monitors attached. In that case, I don't want the authentication process to use the fingerprint reader since I can't reach it. I found a great solution [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/743941/11178).

This solution is for an earlier Ubuntu version, for the current one, the changes have to be made in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`. I added the following line before the "default" block:

```bash
auth   [success=ignore default=1]  pam_exec.so quiet /usr/local/bin/pam_check_lid
```

(this runs the script `pam_check_lid` before the fingerprint reader is used). The script `pam_check_lid` has to be created with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/sh
LID_STATE=$(cat /proc/acpi/button/lid/LID/state | cut -d':' -f2 | tr -d ' ')

case ${LID_STATE} in
    closed)
    echo closed
    exit 1
    ;;
    open*)
    echo open
    exit 0
    ;;
    *)
    # LID is open by default
    echo unknown
    exit 0
    ;;
esac
```

The script needs to be globally readable and executable (but *NOT* writable). I tested the script using `pamtester` at a local copy before moving it to `/etc/pam.d/`:

```bash
$ pamtester common-auth <username> authenticate
```

While at it, I also set the maximum number of tries for the fingerprint up to 3 in `/etc/pam.d/common-auth` (because I often fail to place my finger correctly the first time):

```bash
auth	[success=3 default=ignore]	pam_fprintd.so max-tries=3 timeout=10 # debug
```


### App-switcher vs. Window-switcher in GNOME

In GNOME, there is a distinction between switching between windows on the same screen/workspace (bound to <Alt>+Tab) and switching between applications (bound to <Super>+Tab). I find this confusing and want both <Alt>+Tab and <Super>+Tab to switch between applications. The standard settings in GNOME do not support multiple shortcuts for the same command, so I had to use the `dconf-editor` to change the settings:

![](/pics/app-switcher-ubuntu-dconf.png){width=70%}

I also had to turn off the <Alt>+Tab shortcut for switching between windows in the standard settings.

### Fix lock screen on suspend

Weirdly, even though in the normal "Screen Lock" settings in the Gnome settings, I have set "Lock screen on suspend" it would not do that. I had to toggle the switch in `dconf-editor` that is called `/org/gnome/desktop/lockdown/disable-lock/screen` (it was turned on by default). After disabling the "disable" switch, it is once again working.

### Do not open new windows in fullscreen

Somehow that happened very often and I found it very annoying. I found a solution [here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/1412195/how-can-i-prevent-apps-from-opening-new-windows-in-full-window-mode) that works perfectly. Change the setting under `org.gnome.mutter` to `false` or use

```
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter auto-maximize false
```

### Set default file browser

I prefer the `nemo` file browser over the default `nautilus`. The default app setting in Gnome does not allow to change the default browser, but I found a solution using `xdg-mime` ([link](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Xdg-utils#xdg-mime)):

```bash
$ xdg-mime query default inode/directory 
$ xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory
```

## Cool apps

Some cool apps I stumbled upon and that I use:

- [Astra Monitor](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/6682/astra-monitor/)
- [ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu)
- [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
