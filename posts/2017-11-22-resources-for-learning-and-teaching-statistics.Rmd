This is an on-going collection of resources for learning and teaching statistical concepts.

## Statisticial practices

[p-hacker app](https://www.nicebread.de/introducing-p-hacker/)

: Ned Bicare writes: "I developed an online app that allows to practice creative data analysis and how to polish your p-values. It’s primarily aimed at young researchers who do not have our level of expertise yet, but I guess even old hands might learn one or two new tricks! It’s called “The p-hacker” (please note that ‘hacker’ is meant in a very positive way here. You should think of the cool hackers who fight for world peace). You can use the app in teaching, or to practice p-hacking yourself."

## Visualisations

[Guess the correlation](http://guessthecorrelation.com/)

: Nice retro-look game for learning to guess the strength of the correlation in a cloud of points.

[Seeing Theory](http://students.brown.edu/seeing-theory/)

: a visual introduction to probability and statistics. Many good visualisations.

[R<-Psychologist](http://rpsychologist.com/)

: some cool shiny-based visualisations of important concepts.

    Examples:

    - [Power and NHST](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/NHST/)
    - [Confidence Intervals](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/CI/)
    - [Correlation](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/correlation/)
    - [Cohen's d](http://rpsychologist.com/d3/cohend/)

[Spurious correlations](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations)

: unending list of spurious correlations

[Linear regression demo](http://sites.uclouvain.be/selt/files/medias/unamur-regression-lineaire-module20.swf)

: nice and clean (but french) demo for linear regression

[Sampling Distribution Demo](http://onlinestatbook.com/stat_sim/sampling_dist/index.html)

: nice and interactive demonstration of sampling distributions

## Cool datasets

[Human Penguin Project](https://osf.io/2rm5b/)

: this is a cool many-labs dataset that has many interesting variables and can potentially be used for regression and ANOVA-based exercises

[Open Stats Lab](https://sites.trinity.edu/osl/data-sets-and-activities)

: nice collection of data-sets from real psychological studies that come with detailed assignments to reproduce the analyses from the accompanying papers



## Lectures/tutorials

[Modern Regression by Cosma Shalizi](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/)

: really good but pretty mathematical introduction to regression. Check out the lecture scripts (e.g., [this one](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/mreg/15/lectures/03/lecture-03.pdf))

## Fun stuff

[Why not to trust statistics](https://mathwithbaddrawings.com/2016/07/13/why-not-to-trust-statistics/)

: nice demonstration how measures of central tendency/variance can be misleading; includes bad drawings!
