<p>I am excited to announce that our paper <a href="http://www.jmir.org/2015/9/e197/">Predictors of response to Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy with face-to-face therapist support for depression: A Bayesian analysis</a> has been accepted for publication in the <a href="http://jmir.org">Journal of Medical Internet Research</a> (see below for the full citation). This paper is the result of a fruitful collaboration with <a href="https://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=42301&amp;p_dimension_id=88120">Martin Eisemann</a>'s research group for <a href="https://uit.no/forskning/forskningsgrupper/gruppe?p_document_id=345713">Mental e-Health</a> at the <a href="http://uit.no">University of Tromsø</a>.</p>
<p>The project (that was led by soon-to-be-doctor <a href="https://uit.no/om/enhet/ansatte/person?p_document_id=56149&amp;p_dimension_id=88120">Ragnhild Høifødt</a>) attempted to find individual-level variables that could help to predict whether a web-based treatment for depression would be effective or not. While the actual finding in the paper are fascinating (and I do recommend that you read it!), here I would like to say a few words about my experiences about publishing the Bayesian analyses (that are promised in the title). This is my second paper that used entirely Bayesian statistics (my first one was a paper on the neural basis of mind-wandering) and I learned a lot while working on the paper, both about appropriate analyses for this kind of data and about the process of publishing such analyses in communitites that are not yet used to it. The technical details are pretty much spelled out in the supplemental material (and, if you ask kindly, I am more than happy to share my R/JAGS code).</p>
<p>One issue that was immediately obvious to me was the need for a proper documentation of the used models. It is all to common for papers in area to say something like "linear mixed growth-models were used" relying on the common language of the readership and assuming that everyone who will find this paper interesting in the future will immediately be able to infer exactly which analysis was run. I think this is a misconception. Even standard models have different names in different literatures and there are many different ways to calculate p-values, confidence intervals etc for more complicated statistical analyses. Also, standard methods can and will change in the future and it is not guaranteed that a researcher in the field twenty years in the future will be able to infer (and reproduce!) the exact analyses that were conducted. While people get away with this sort of thing when using null-hypothesis-testing (presumably because at least the reviewers DO know which models have been run as there are limited options), a Bayesian model is individually tailored to its application and needs a careful description. I therefore wrote up the model in a very unusual format, detailing all used distributionary assumptions, parameter transformations, priors etc. The methods portion grew accordingly and it was pretty obvious that this would be a hard-to-read paper. Still, I did what I felt was the right thing and sent it out to JMIR for review.</p>
<p>I was positively surprised by the generally positive attitude of the editor and the reviewers who welcomed the Bayesian approach. However, one of the reviewers mentioned that</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[…] the justification of Bayesian methods seem somewhat over-enthuasiastic and perhaps unnecessarily dismissive of null-hypthesis testing (I am no fan of null-hypothesis testing either, but still had some doubts with regard to the way this was justified here). Bayesian methods are introduced as being "preferable", "more flexible", "more readily interpretable"; and so forth - but they also strike me (at least the way they are presented here) as complex to the point of seeming obsure (at least to the non-expert).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fair enough -- it took me 6 pages to detail the used models while most methods section in similar papers using traditional models use maybe a paragraph. Here is my response:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>[…] the reviewer argues that Bayesian methods are perceived as being too complex or even obscure. We argue, that this perception is solely due to the conventional practice in publishing statistical analysis. A standardized frequentist analysis (e.g., a linear mixed model fit by ML) is easy to follow for the educated reader but this is solely because of the highly standardized nature of this type of analysis. A reader from a different field of study (where statistical nomenclature and standards may be different) will have a hard time reading a "standard" statistical analysis that are so familiar to us. We wrote the methods section in a way that it is comprehensible for a statistically educated reader from any field but we do acknowledge that this came at the cost of readability for more applied readers. If standard analyses would be reported in the same comprehensive way (discussing all hidden assumptions), the description would most certainly fill more pages than we used and seem quite obscure (given that many of the assumptions and concepts underlying NHST are much less intuitive than the Bayesian equivalents).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is basically what I wrote above, if you want to write up all the details of traditional methods, the section would be just as long. Anyway, the reviewer went on to make some important points. In particular I found this statement interesting:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Moreover, a main argument for the Bayesian methods seems to be that they present a welcome shift away from arbitrary accepting or rejecting hypotheses based on whether the significance level of .05 is achieved or not. If this is the case, then why present the "Bayes Factor" statistics, which seem to again introduce somewhat rigid guidelines as to when H1 or H0 is supported (e.g., Bayes Factor &gt; 10: "strong evidence for H1"). Wouldn't a more conventional presentation of effect sizes and confidence intervals achieve the same purpose, but in a much more efficient manner (and one that might be more familiar to most readers, although "familiarity is better" is admittedly a very weak argument)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It refers to Jeffrey's table that assigns labels to different ranges the Bayes factor can take (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor">it is on wikipedia</a>) and I agree that these labels should be taken with a grain of salt. Here is what I responded:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Bayes Factors quantify the degree of evidence that the data provides in favor of either the null- or the alternative hypothesis. It is thus fundamentally different from p-values (or confidence intervals, at that). However, the interpretation provided in Table 1 to which the reviewer objects is indeed not uncontroversial (similar tables with different wordings and different cut-off values have been proposed). We do not want to put too much emphasis at these labels but rather focus on the exact interpretation of the Bayes Factor: how much more likely one hypothesis is than the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was, however, a little afronted by the suggestion that effect sizes and confidence intervals would carry the same information in a more efficient way:</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>The information contained in the BF is not identical to effect sizes and/or confidence intervals and we argue strongly that confidence intervals are neither more efficient nor more easily interpreted. In fact, research shows that confidence intervals are robustly misinterpreted even by trained researchers (Hoekstra et al., 2014). In their study, they asked a sample of psychological researchers conceptual questions about which questions confidence intervals could or could not answer and they found that 97 % of the researchers failed to correctly answer all questions (meaning that 97% of the researchers fell into at least one fallacy surrounding the interpretation of confidence intervals). We are of the opinion that Bayes Factors are far easier interpretable, by comparison. As an alternative to effect sizes + confidence intervals, we do report the mode of the posterior distribution of the parameter estimates and their 95% highest density interval (the Bayesian equivalent of a confidence interval that is much less subject to misinterpretation) […].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, in the meantime, I took the time to read Morey's excellent paper <a href="https://learnbayes.org/papers/confidenceIntervalsFallacy/">The Fallacy of Placing Confidence in Confidence Intervals</a> wich contains some excellent and pedagogical examples how confidence intervals can be misleading.</p>
<p>After long discussions, we concluded in outsourcing the technical details of the Bayesian analysis into a supplemental material and wrote a short, relatively superficial summary for the main paper. I think this is a rather nice way to trade off readability and comprehensibility and think that I will use this model in the future. However, it has several shortcomings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>the supplemental material is not itself citable</li>
<li>while the supplemental material does undergo peer review, it is probably not subject to the same strict quality checks as the main paper (I often find typos and more serious errors in these materials).</li>
</ol>
<p>Given that these supplemental materials are often the most important source of information when considering reproducibility of the research (especially in papers using the ultra-short format that is typical for high-impact journals), I think that their status should be enhanced. One possibility would be to publish two versions of the same paper, one "long" version that includes all the details and a "short" version that does not. In todays world where no one actually prints full journals anymore (or does that still happen?), this should not be too much of a problem. A second method would be to make supplemental little stand-alone papers that get their own DOI such that they are at least directly citable.</p>
